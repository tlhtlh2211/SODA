# Unofficial Implementation of SODA: Bottleneck Diffusion Models for Representation Learning

## Project Description

This repository contains an unofficial implementation of SODA (Self-Supervised Object Detection via Data Augmentation) focusing on bottleneck diffusion. This project is developed as part of Course Related Project 2 at VinUniversity, aimed at exploring and implementing state-of-the-art techniques in computer vision.
